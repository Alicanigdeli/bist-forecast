ARIMA Model Project


This is a project that demonstrates the use of the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model to analyze time series data.

Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

data/: Contains the time series data in a CSV file format.
arima_model.py: Contains the Python code for building and fitting the ARIMA model.
forecasting.py: Contains the Python code for using the fitted ARIMA model to make forecasts.
results/: Contains the output of the ARIMA model and the forecasting results, including the predicted values and diagnostic plots.
README.md: This file.

Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local system.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the command python arima_model.py to fit the ARIMA model to the time series data.
Run the command python forecasting.py to use the fitted model to make forecasts.
The ARIMA model will be fitted to the time series data using various methods, including plot_acf and plot_pacf to determine the ARIMA order parameter and auto_arima to select the best model. The predicted values and diagnostic plots will be output to the results/ directory. The forecasting results will also be output to the results/ directory.

Results

The ARIMA model was able to accurately fit the time series data, as shown by the diagnostic plots. The forecasting results demonstrate the ability of the ARIMA model to make accurate predictions about future values in the time series.

Conclusion

The ARIMA model is a powerful tool for analyzing time series data. By carefully selecting the parameters of the model, we can make accurate predictions about future values in the time series. In this project, we used a combination of visualization techniques and statistical methods to select the best ARIMA model. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the selected model and its ability to make accurate predictions about future values in the time series.
